## Poker
Created by lecturer.  
Is available to play.

## Blackjack
### Instructions to Run
1. Run jar package.
2. Select option 2
3. Enter details as prompted
4. Place bet using numbers when prompted
5. Select action option using the number label when prompted

### Justification of Implementation
Due to the distinct differences between Blackjack and Poker, despite their similarities, it was necessary to create standalone classes such as Player, DeckofCards, GameOfBlackjack, etc. Many of the code present in the Poker classes were replicated and modified to accomodate Blackjack. This is because extending the classes did not seem correct as Blackjack is not Poker. Additionally, it would require overriding many of the methods, making it difficult to debug. Thus, it was better to create them as standalone classes.

## Texas Hold'Em
### Instructions to run
1. Run jar package
2. Select option 3
3. Enter details as prompted
4. Follow prompts to play game

### Justification of Implementation
Since permission to edit the poker package was given, we tried to make minimal changes to the package in order to reuse the code. The implementation for Texas Hold'Em was done as abstract as possible to enable smooth development of Texas Scramble in the future.

## Texas Scramble
### Instructions to run
1. Run jar package
2. Select option 4
3. Enter name when prompted
4. Enter number of players to play with, with 1 being minimum and 9 being the maximum
5. Follow prompts to play game

### Note
1. Blank tile is represented by **^**.
2. For Texas Scramble: TestCanFormString is trying to reproduce the bug TA meets, the input cases TA provided are replicated in the test, code works good and no bug is found.
